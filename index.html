                <p>I am a software Developer who lives in the Seattle area.  I am currently studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the UW coding Bootcamp.  
                I love to hike and stay in shape. I organize hikes for my friends.  I have a broad range of technical skills and I like to learn new things. I can juggle and ride a unicycle, but not at the same time. 
                I have a strong spiritual component in my life.
